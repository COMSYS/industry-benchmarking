# Configuation of SW-PIBs functionality.
# These options concern the offloading and evaluation capabilities.

mode: encrypted #encrypted or plaintext
evaluation: true # Wheter evaluation is performed (this implies that the computation is performed twice (once encrypted and once in plain for accuracy))
networking: false # This option does not influence the functionality of SW-PIB
offload: # Operations that will be offloaded by default. In this case, only strictly necessary operations are selected
